Build a JavaScript application
Requirements
Build an application that shows the target indicator
Required design below:


The application content should be centered on a web page vertically and horizontally
Get the initial value ($14) from this URL using AJAX
Animation Rules:
onLoad, indicator bar grows from position 0 to the initial value 14
Increase the value from 14 by $0.2 every 2 seconds
Once the value reaches the target, change the background of the [Target $15] square from gray (as on screenshot) to green (#00A910) and hide “You need...” text
Packaging
You can publish your application on GitHub. As a result, please, send us an URL of a workable version on GitHub Pages, so we could be able to open application instantly.
Or you can send us an independant zip archive that contains compiled application that could be launched locally on any machine without an obligation to install any software.
